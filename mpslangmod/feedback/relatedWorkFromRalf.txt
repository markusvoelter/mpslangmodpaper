I am going through the related work comments of the reviewers and add some things here and there.

---------------------


  MERNIK, Marjan, ZUMER, Viljem. Incremental programming language development. 
  Comput. syst. struct., 2005, Vol. 31, pp. 1-16

Definitely worth reviewing both for political reasons and because it is relatively recent and it sort of surveys some relevant part of the universe.

---------------------
   Aspect-oriented extension of LISA has been described in:
   REBERNAK, Damijan, MERNIK, Marjan, HENRIQUES, Pedro Rangel, DA CRUZ, Daniela, 
   VARANDO PEREIRA, Maria Jo‹o. Specifying Languages Using Aspect-oriented Approach: 
   AspectLISA. CIT. J. Comput. Inf. Technol., 2006, vol. 14, no. 4, pp. 343-350

  REBERNAK, Damijan, MERNIK, Marjan, WU, Hui, GRAY, Jeffrey G. Domain-specific 
  aspect languages for modularising crosscutting concerns in grammars. IET softw., 
  Jun. 2009, vol. 3, iss. 3, pp. 184-200.

Well, this is getting much from the same folks, but this is on topic. I am concerned that if you just cite these three Mernik papers, then we are not doing justice. Let's see.

---------------------

  * Last paragraph (page 6, before section 2.3), please look into the work on SmartTools [PCDFPFHA2002],
     or the ALOE of GANDALF [MF81].

This is pretty old stuff, but this might be good references (I only know the former) to show the long tradition of IDE research. I don't see how you can easily summarize the differences between MPS and potentially everything what has existed in the past, but probably you have some ways of saying that already.


---------------------

 * Please add to the bullet on SQL (page 7) a reference to work performed by Ralf Laemmel 
    and Erik Meijer.

Is that in the context of adding SQL to a language?
Well, that would be mainly LINQ papers and that would be Meijer and others (not me).
I did two papers on SQL/XML impedance mismatch with Erik, but I wonder whether the reviewer had this really in mind.


---------------------

 * In the part on "dnq" please add a reference to the recent work on Rascal by Jurgen 
    Vinju and Paul Klint.

Referencing Rascal somewhere seems sound.
Do you have a way of assessing Rascal's language composition capabilities?

---------------------

  * SmartTools is closer related than Xtext.

Ok, Smarttools were mentioned before. Mentioning this (again) sounds Ok.

---------------------

    if you mention Spoofax
    why not mention the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment as well.

Indeed, ASF+SDF MetaEnvironment should be mentioned.
It is one of these popular systems for generic language technology including IDE support.

This or the other SmartTools reference.

Ok, this is a classic that I don't know (or don't remember).



---------------------

Perhaps some reference to Hibernate, JDO and JPA (also expand acronyms) is needed
Cite references for JSP, Velocity and FreeMarker on page 7
Ref for Misra-C, Osek, and Mindstorms on page 8

On page 9, instead of the URL for Antlr, there are also books and papers about 
it that could be cited

I strongly disagree. Using URLs is Ok for citing technologies that have NOT been grown dominantly in the academic literature. Also, for JDO and JPA etc., yes, I would expand the acronyms (and perhaps add a tiny phrase of explanation), but I would not try to find academic literature.



---------------------

component-based design has a URL to a Wikipedia entry. There are many 
good books and articles that would serve as better references and could be added to 
the bibliography.

That's difficult. Our community does not (yet) accept Wikipedia to be used in this manner for conceptual terms. If you have good scholarly references, please use them; otherwise remove the Wikipedia reference. (Unfortunately.)




---------------------

ÒThe challenge of grammar composition is not an issue in MPS at all, since 
  no grammars and parsers are usedÓ. But, language composition is not just grammar 
  composition! Semantics is much more important. 
  
-> I disagree. Many systems can't even do syntax, so the semantics issue never comes up!  

I think this is the point which reveals the broader expectation regarding related work:


- modular IDE-specific aspects
- modular type system/semantics
- modular syntax

For modular syntax, here are some things perhaps you haven't though of.

http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/conf/oopsla/BravenboerTV06



I am not saying that these are directly the right ones, but you could do some chasing from them that may lead to good coverage I believe.



More generally, I also realize that you probably want to refer more to E. Visser's work:

http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/v/Visser:Eelco.html



There is stuff on parsing (SDF), debgugging, and others.

More related to the IDE front, there is SugarJ, or did you refer to this already.

http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/conf/oopsla/ErdwegKRKOV11



Overall, the challenge will be to discuss related work at a level of abstraction that a) does not insult the normal academic reviewer; b) does not get lost in too many details of this extremely diverse and rich area.



A few words on modular semantics in closing.
Often, the term extensibility in the more formal area of semantics.


I have some papers, from which could perhaps could extract from related work picture:

http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/waga99/
http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/pepm99/


http://homepages.cwi.nl/~ralf/jlap04/

Keywords that come to mind:
- Modular SOS (P. Mosses)


- Action semantics (ditto)
- Monads in denotational semantics (E. Moggi)


- Various notions of modular attribute grammars (see my WAGA paper)



Have fun and regards,
Ralf
