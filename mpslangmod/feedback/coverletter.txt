Based on the feedback there are two major shortcomings. The first one is that the way
the paper is structured it is not an academic paper. The second shortcoming is a degree
of sloppiness. I address these two major issues here in the cover letter. I will also 
address the issues in the three reviews specifically.

Academic Rigor:
----------------------
PROBLEMS: The paper does not introduce the various modularization and composition techniques
well enough; it does not define them; it does not have enough related work and references.

EXPLANATION: My understanding was that I had been invited to GTTSE primarily to
give a tutorial and that the paper is accompanying material. I wrote it in a way that
is appropriate for a *tutorial*, not as an academic paper. Obviously this was a mis-
understanding on my part, and I could have avoided it by looking at earlier GTTSE papers.

WHAT I DID: This revision addresses this problem by completely rewriting the introduction,
the related work and the discussion section. In contrast to what some of the reviews suggest,
I am aware of many of the related works (not all that were suggested). However, because of my
misinterpretation of the goal of the paper, I did not include them. This revision changes this.


Sloppiness:
--------------------------
PROBLEMS: Typos, Formulations, Various formatting issues  

EXPLANATION: Another misunderstanding. The version I submitted before GTTSE was called a draft.
I mistook this to mean that it's a rough writeup of what I will talk about in the tutorial. I was
told that there would be a change to refine the draft after the conference, before the final submission
to the proceedings. 

WHAT I DID: First of all: sorry to the reviewers for having to read a paper with so many typos and
mistakes in the text. Obviously this is fixed now in the current release.
