smarttools:
* xml schema to define AS
* Editor with different views
  structure editor is default
* No Type Sys beyond schema structure
  (only visitor is directly supported)
  (it is generated; but still rest of the 
   type check code is manual Java)
* no convenient way for editing expressions etc.
  friendly syntax via parsers! 
  -> problem when modularized languages
  -> and not automaticsally generated
  -> extra syntax spec; not clear how to modularize
  -> parser managager selects parser per file -> homo!
* for trafo via xpp
* custom views via Swning-Bean per AST class
  -> not very good for real text editing -> parser
* ast can also be defined with a custom DSL
* Multi-View! Nice!
* nobody talks about composition

gandalf
* generate IDE from editor
* lang is defined via denotational semantics
* It is not clear how sophisticated the editor is
* nobody talks about composition
=> ALOEGEN

AbleP
* Extensible Promela
* Language Extensions, can be imported by the user
* (arbitrary) extensions can be combined
* parser-based
* No IDE
* COPPER and SILVER are the tools to do this. 
* COPPER grammar, SILVER semantics
* Context-aware scanning -> like SDF stuff
* mostly extensions, since extension grammars must be certified relative to host lang gra
* SILVER: extensible Attr Grammar 
* Lang Extensions can attach new attributes to existing grammar elements
  -> extensible type checking
* embedding (e.g. C grammar in promela) is possible --- separated by LR state
  (i.e. not in the same context)
* Enhaned LR Parsing
* Silver/Copper: need to write disambig functions for combinations,
  so if A and B langs exts are cobined in a program, a disamb functione may be necessary
  not so in MPS
  
* It seems that the semantic aspects (type sys) are relatively well solved
  via attribute grammars and forwarding to make it extensible.  
 
* in the extension part. silver_van_wyk page 4 nicely describe under which
  circumstances extensions can be "generated down" easily: local
* context aware scanning with copper; LALR(1)
* Also have precedence and associativity declaratively
* Silver is itself extensible

Lisa
-----------------
* from lang -> editor (conc, structured), compiler/intp, other tools
* they say something about modularity, but no details
* multiple attribute grammar inheritance (TS, etc.)
* inheritance, and possibly also embedding
* AspectLisa uses Aspects to handle CCC
* Still parsed; problem with composing grammars


=> AspectG, AspectASF
=> JastAdd

Polyglott
--------------------------
* extensible parser generator PPG with grammar inheritance
* add, modify, or remove productions and symbols of the base grammar.
* multi-pass compilers.



Weaving a Debugging Aspect into Domain-Specific Language Grammars
----------------------
* weave debug info into ANTLR grammars



Verifiable Composition of Deterministic Grammars
----------------------------------------------------
Discusses how to detect early how grammars that are about to be composed if they
are compatible. This problem does not exist in Proj Ed.


Modular SOS: Differences from SOS
------------------------------------------------
Modular Structural Operatiojal Semantics


Composing Programming Languages by Combining Action-Semantics Modules
-------------------------
* Semantics for ASF SDF languages; 
* goal: realistic
* modular
* primitive actions, can be composed into more complex 
  actions - those are integrated into ASF+SDF definitions;
  the latter are modular, and so are the equations

Semantics formally
