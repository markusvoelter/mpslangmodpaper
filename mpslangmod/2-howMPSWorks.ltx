\section{How MPS works}
\vspace{-2mm}
\label{HowMPSWorks}

The JetBrains Meta Programming System\footnote{http://jetbrains.com/mps} is a
projectional language workbench available as open source software under the
Apache 2.0 license. The term Language Workbench was coined by Martin
Fowler~\cite{Fowler2004}. He defines a language workbench as a tool with
the following characteristics:

\begin{enumerate}   
  \item Users can freely define languages which are fully integrated with
  each other.

  \item The primary source of information is a persistent abstract
  representation.

  \item A DSL is defined in three main parts: schema, editor(s), and
  generator(s).

  \item Language users manipulate a DSL through a projectional editor.

  \item A language workbench can persist incomplete or contradictory
  information.

\end{enumerate}

\noindent MPS exhibits all of these characteristics. MPS' most distinguishing
feature is its projectional editor. This means that all text, symbols, and
graphics are projected, and not parsed. Projectional editing is well-known from
graphical modeling tools (UML, Entity-Relationship, State Charts). In those
tools only the model structure is persisted, often using XML or a database. For
editing purposes, graphical editors project the abstract syntax using graphical
shapes. Users use mouse gestures and keyboard actions tailored to graphical
editing to modify the model structure directly. While the CS of the
model does not have to be stored because it is specified as part of the language
definition and hence known by the projection engine, graphical modeling tools
usually also store information about the visual layout.

Projectional editing can also be used for textual syntax. However, since the
projection looks like text, users expect editing gestures known from "real text"
to work. MPS achieves this quite well (it is beyond the scope of this paper to
describe how). The following is a list of benefits of projectional editing:

\begin{itemize}   
  \item No grammar or parser is required. Editing directly changes the
  underlying structure. Projectional editors can handle unparseable code.
  Language composition is made easy, because it cannot
  result in ambiguous grammars.

  \item Graphical, symbolic, tabular and textual notations can be mixed and
  combined, and they can be defined with the same formalism and approach. For
  example, a graphical tool for editing state machines can embed a textual expression
  language for editing the guard conditions on
  transitions\footnote{Intentional's Domain Workbench has demonstrated this
  repeatedly, for example in~\cite{SimonyiCC06}. As of 2012, MPS can do text,
  symbols (such as big sum signs or fraction bars) and tables.
  Graphics will be supported in 2013.}.

  \item Since projectionally defined languages always need an IDE for
  editing (to do the projection), language definition and composition
  always implies IDE definition and composition. The IDE provides code
  completion, error checking and syntax highlighting for any valid language,
  composed or not.

  \item Since the model is stored independent of its concrete notation, it is
  possible to represent the same model in different ways simply by providing
  several projections. Different viewpoints of the overall program can be
  stored in one model, but editing can still be viewpoint-specific. It is also
  possible to store out-of-band data (i.e. annotations on the core
  model). Examples of the latter include documentation, pointers to
  requirements (traceability) or feature dependencies in the context of
  product lines.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Projectional editors also have drawbacks. The first one is that
editing the projected representation as opposed to "real text" needs some time
to get used to. Without specific customization, every program element has to be
selected from a drop-down list to be "instantiated". However, MPS provides
editor customizations to enable an editing experience that resembles modern IDEs
that use automatically expanding code templates. This makes editing in MPS quite
convenient and productive in all but the most exceptional cases. The second
drawback is that models are not stored as readable text, but rather as an
XML-serialized AST. Integrating XML files with an otherwise ASCII-based
development infrastructure can be a challenge. MPS addresses the most critical
aspect of this drawback by supporting diff and merge on the level of the
projected CS. A final drawback is that MPS is not based on any industry
standards. For example, it does not rely on EMF\footnote{http://eclipse.org/emf}
or another widely used modeling formalism. However, since MPS' meta-metamodel is
extremely close to EMF Ecore, it is trivial to build an EMF exporter. Also, all
other language workbenches also do not support portability of the \emph{language
definition} beyond the AS--- which is trivial in terms of implementation effort.

MPS has been designed to work with sets of integrated languages.
This makes MPS particularly well suited to demonstrate \lmrc\ techniques. In
particular, the following three characteristics are important in this context:

\vspace{-1.5mm}
\phead{Composable Syntax} Depending on the particular composition approach,
composition of the CS is required. In traditional, grammar-based systems,
combining independently developed grammars can be a problem: many grammar
classes are not closed under composition, and various invasive changes (such as
left-factoring or redefinition of terminals or non-terminals), or unwanted
syntactic escape symbols are required~\cite{KatsVW10}. As we will see, this is
not the case in MPS. Arbitrary languages can be combined syntactically.

\vspace{-1.5mm}
\phead{Extensible Type Systems} All composition techniques require some
degree of type system extension or composition. MPS' type system specification
is based on declarative typing rules that are executed by a solver. This
way, additional typing rules for additional language constructs can be defined
without invasively changing the existing typing rules of the composed languages.

\vspace{-1.5mm}
\phead{Modular Transformation Framework} Transformations can be defined
separately for each language concept. If a new language concept is added via a
composition technique, the transformation for this new concept is modular. If
existing transformation must be overridden or a certain program structure must
be treated specially, a separate transformation for these cases can be written,
and, using generator priorities, it can be configured to run \emph{before} an
existing transformation.

\noindent The examples discussed in this paper will elaborate on these
characteristics. This is why for each technique, we discuss structure and
syntax, type system and transformation concerns.
