The paper discusses MPS. The topic in itself is very interesting, MPS
seems to be a powerful system.
In that sense it is a valuable contribution to the GTTSE body of
knowledge. The paper has been completely
rewritten and the author seriously addressed the concerns raised in my
report and as far as I can judge also
in the reports by the other reviewers. However, there are still a few
concerns I would like to raise. The author
managed to raise the scientific level of the paper and managed to make
it less temporary. The readability
and accessibility of Section 4 has been tremendously improved as well
as the reflection in Section 5.

The remark in the second paragraph (page 2) raises the question on
semantics. Semantics is much harder
than syntax and so far almost all language workbenches are syntax
oriented, including MPS. This aspect
returns on page 9, where the "Extensible Type Systems" are discussed.
This discussion is too concise to
really make sense, the same holds for page 11: "Type System".

With respect to the discussion on templates, I would advice the author
to have a look at the following two
publications:
Arnoldus, B.J., Brand, M.G.J. van den, Serebrenik, A. & Brunekreef,
J.J. (2012). Code generation with templates. Amsterdam-Paris-Beijing:
Atlantis Press.
Arnoldus, B.J., Bijpost, J.W. & Brand, M.G.J. van den (2007). Repleo:
a syntax-safe template engine. Proceedings of the 6th International
Conference on Generative Programming and Component Engineering (GPCE
2007) 1-3 October 2007, Salzburg, Austria. (pp. 25-32). New York, New
York: ACM.
These publications address a number of issues raised by the author.

A few small issues:
- The first sentence of the abstract is grammatically incorrect.
- Reference 21 is strange wrt the name of the author.
