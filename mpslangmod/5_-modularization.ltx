\label{extAndComp}

In this section we discuss the four \lmrc\ techniques introduced in
\sect{typesOfMod}, plus an additional one that works only with a projectional
editor such as MPS. For the first four, we provide a concise prose definition
plus a set of formulas. We then illustrate each technique with a detailed
MPS-based example based on the \ic{entities} language introduced earlier.
