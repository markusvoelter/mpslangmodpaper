\label{extAndComp}

In this section we discuss the four \lmrc\ techniques introduced in the previous
section, plus an additional one that works only with a projectional editor such
as MPS. For the first four, we provide a concise verbal definition plus a set of
formulas to nail down the specifics. We then illustrate each technique with a
detailed MPS-based example that relates to the \ic{entities} language
introduced earlier.
